<p><strong>7 Ways to Keep Wine Cool This Summer</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>For wine lovers, there's one major challenge every summer. Hot weather make it hard to achieve the most enjoyable serving temperature for wine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Like any issue, keeping wine cool needs the appropriate tools and know-how. These are our favorite methods and tips to conquer your single most-important summer problem and keep your wine experience cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Good Old Refrigerator</strong></p>
<p>It might be obvious, but unless you live near the poles, your good old refrigerator is your wine&rsquo;s best friend in summer. Yes, even the reds. If it&rsquo;s at room temperature around 70&ordm;F/21&ordm;C, refrigerate it for 15 minutes before serving to bring it down to a more enjoyable64&ordm;F/18&ordm;C. If your red is warmer (say 75&ordm;F/24&ordm;C), give it half an hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whites and ros&eacute;s will take a solid hour to be brought down to a good serving temp of about 50&ordm;F/10&ordm;C. If you like your wine extra cold (42&ordm;F/6&ordm;C), two hours in the fridge prior to pouring should do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ice Bucket</strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about wine through the summer season, you must have an ice bucket. If you don&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t mind the casual look, just use a bucket from your garage. If you don&rsquo;t have ice, even a bucket of cool water will keep your wine at a lower temperature for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ice buckets work even better if you add salt. Fresh water cannot go below 32&ordm;F/0&ordm;C without freezing solid. Adding some salt to it will allow it to reach a lower temperature and chill your wine faster.</p>

<p>Bonus tip: Drinking outdoors and you don&rsquo;t have a bucket? Submerge the bottle in a body of water (a fountain, river, lake, even in the sea). Just don&rsquo;t forget to secure it with some rope!</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cooling Sleeves</strong></p>
<p>These, like the&nbsp;VacuVin Active Cooler, are frozen materials in a jacket that surrounds the bottle. They work best if your wine is already cool, but won&rsquo;t chill a warm wine down as dramatically. Look out at the wine shop; some brands give some away if you buy their wine.</p>

<p><strong>Automated Wine Chillers</strong></p>
<p>More sophisticated versions of ice buckets are automated wine chillers. Like the&nbsp;Cooper Cooler, these are like small fridges in the shape of a bucket, generally holding one bottle or two. These can be expensive, but are nice if you can afford one, as you can precisely control and maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cooling Pour Spouts</strong></p>
<p>If you want to be on cold wine&rsquo;s cutting edge, innovations have taken place over the past few years. Now, several manufacturers offer systems that can actually chill your wine instantly as you pour.</p>
<p>These cooling pour spouts are inserted into the bottle&rsquo;s opening, with systems such as Corkcicle,&nbsp;Host, and a new system called&nbsp;RAVI Instant wine chiller.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unconventional Ice Cubes</strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve failed with our 5 Tactics for Preserving an Open Bottle of Wine and you don&rsquo;t feel like using any of those 3 tips to make the most of your leftover wine, you can always freeze your leftover wine in an ice cube tray and later use the cubes to cool down your next wine. The only problem? You might end up blending different wines as the cubes melt.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img style="max-width:100%;" src="http://api.tagtalk.co/pics/newsfeed_contents/seven_ways_to_keep_wine_cool/pics/3.png" alt="pic3" width="300" height="256" /></p>
<p>To cool down your wine without diluting or blending it, you can actually use frozen grape. It&rsquo;s fun and it makes the grapes tasty, too. However, we don&rsquo;t advise to use them on expensive wines, but it&rsquo;s fine with your easy-drinking summer vinos.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Put your wine in the freezer</strong></p>
<p>Some say this is a dangerous thing to do, but it&rsquo;s actually fine as long as you control timing of the process. Freezing wine is horrible; cooling it down in the freezer is just fine. 15 minutes for a mild chill, half an hour for major chilling results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also not the most advisable thing to do on very fine bottles, but is fine for everyday wines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But of course, to really be ready to sip all summer, always keep a bottle of wine in your fridge for unexpected reasons to share a refreshing glass. Room allowing, keep one bottle of white, one of ros&eacute;, and don&rsquo;t forget the bubbly!</p>
