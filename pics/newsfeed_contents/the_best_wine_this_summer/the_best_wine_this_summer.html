<p><strong>The Best Wine For Hot Dogs and Sausages</strong></p>
<p><br /> <strong>When summer BBQs and baseball games start filling up the calendar, it's safe to say hot dogs will be on the menu, and wine can be there too!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When picking a wine to pair with summertime sausage, the type of dog and its toppings are equals in the paring equation. Is your dog a bratwurst topped with sauerkraut and spicy brown mustard or a chili dog smothered in spicy beans and melted cheese?&nbsp;</p>
<p>For heavily topped dogs, the best wine will match the toppings. For chili dogs this means a rich, fruit-laden&nbsp;Zinfandel&nbsp;or&nbsp;Spanish Grenache.</p>
<p>For classic, condiment-topped sausages, the best pairings will cut through the grease and salt of the sausage, leaving you refreshed and ready for the next decadent bite. Both acid and tannin in wines counteract fat, so zippy white wines and light-bodied reds are ideal with this summertime staple.</p>
<p>Gr&uuml;nerVeltiner, a bright and mineral-driven white from Austria is a fantastic match for classic, ballpark-style franks. Stainless steel winemaking, lots of citrus aromas, and a mineral-driven finish make these wines extremely refreshing.</p>
<p>Their light body also helps Gr&uuml;nerVeltliner complement, rather than overpower, simple hot dogs. Plus, they're often lightly sparkling&mdash;think spritzy&mdash;making them even more thirst-quenching on a hot summer day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to reds,&nbsp;Pinot Noir&mdash;especially from California&mdash;is a consistently great match, especially with well-seasoned sausages like Bratwurst or sweet and spicy Italian links. In these instances, the spiciness of the wine and sweet, oaky aromas compliment the earthy, herbaceous tones of the sausage.</p>
<p>Bright berry fruit and judicious oak mean the wines are still fresh during July heat waves, and are also great with a chill. Likewise, light Italian reds&mdash;think&nbsp;Barbera&nbsp;or Dolcetto&mdash;that offer similar red fruit qualities with earthy undertones also make for great combinations with sausages fresh off the grill.</p>
