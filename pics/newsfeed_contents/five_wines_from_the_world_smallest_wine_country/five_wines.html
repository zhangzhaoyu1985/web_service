<p><strong>5 Wines from the World's Smallest Wine Country</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Belgium is known throughout the world for its chocolate and beer, but did you know wine grapes have grown on Belgian soil since the early Middle Ages? Although the Little Ice Age, wars, and urbanization have taken its toll on Belgian viticulture, ongoing efforts since the mid-20th century have revived its old traditions.<br /> <br /> Like neighbors Luxemburg, Netherlands, UK and most of Germany, Belgium is a cold-climate wine country, producing mainly sparkling (48%) and white wines (32%) from about 50 different grapes. These grapes range from regional hybrids to internationally acclaimed varieties like Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Riesling and Pinot Noir. Since Belgium is so northern and cold, the majority of grapes are grown in relatively warmer microclimates, like wall-enclosed vineyards, south facing slopes, near rivers, or near patches of forests that offer protection from the cold.<br /> <br /> Currently around 90 growers are cultivating wine grapes on a mere 185 hectares, which makes Belgium the world's smallest wine producer among countries with officially recognized and designated wine regions. Belgium is a true hidden gem!<br /> <br /> So next time you're visiting Europe, or traveling from one of Belgium's bigger neighbors, why not stop along the way and visit a few historical cities, pioneering wineries and great-quality restaurants to get a taste of what Belgium has to offer?<br /> <br /> To give you a sneak peek of what Belgian winemakers are capable of here are a few of recommendations:</p>
